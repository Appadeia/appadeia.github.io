                <h1>Governmental Overivew</h1>
                Groponigën is a parliamentary monarchy led by Queen Milaw Oakforrest. The current constitution was
                written by the G Party with input from the MU and GCP. <br>
                There are two houses of legislation, the Parliament and the Metaparlia, which combine to form the
                Reichstag. As of writing, the Metaparlia does not meet or hold elections yet because the population has
                not hit 100 people yet. <br>
                The courts are ruled by an Ubercourt which functions as the supreme law of the land, as well as an
                unnamed minor court.

                <h1>First Things To Do</h1>
                <p>
                    Upon arriving in Groponigën, you should give yourself a first name and a last name. <br>
                    The next thing to do is to say hello to the locals and get familiar with the country. <br>
                    It wouldn't be a bad idea to brush on the citizenship laws which can be located in <span channel>#law-ref</span>.
                    <br>
                    You should also get yourself a political party.

                <h1>Political Parties</h1>
                Here are a list of current political parties.
                <h2>G Party (GP) [Centrist/Unaffilated] </h2>
                <p>
                    A party best known for its emphasis on building up a structure for the government than leaning to
                    any issues. Really doesn't care if you try to turn Groponigën into a facist or communist place as
                    long as you leave it alone. Created by the merger of Municipal Assistive-Informative D Party and
                    Groponigën Direct Democratic Party. At the beginning, some of its members went off to join the BCP,
                    now the GCP. Notable achievements: Wrote majority of the constitution, leader was the de facto
                    negotiator of peace in the Groponigën-Blepia-Birblands war.
                </p>
                <h2>Groponigën Clichque Party (GCP) [Conservative/Facist] </h2>
                <p>
                    The facist/conservative party of Groponigën. Wants to turn Groponigën into a corporate state with
                    corporations being guilds of workers. Hates the monarchy and wants to abolish it. Formerly the
                    Blepian Clichque Party, but rebranded after controversy. Notable achivements: Constitution proposal
                    was the inspiration for the G Party's constitution.
                </p>
                <h2>Monarchist's Union (MU) [Conservative] </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the oldest parties of Groponigën. Loves the queen and believes everything is just fine as it
                    is. Really doesn't like the GCP. Despite only a few people being active writing laws from the MU,
                    its members always turn up to vote. Notable achievements: Founded the economy.
