                        Justifiably Greenland's most visited 
                        area and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2004, this amazing berg-strewn 
                        section of coast in Disko Bay is where huge glaciers 'calve', an expression meaning that icebergs 
                        break off from the glaciers and float out into the coastal waters.
                        <br>
                        This is a perfect place, if you're lucky enough to get 
                        the timing right, to witness this awe-inspiring natural spectacle, which can be watched from land. The immense glacier
                        Sermeq Kujalleq, more than five kilometers wide and one kilometer thick, feeds into the bay. Be prepared for stunning vistas and nature
                        at its most majestic.

                        Visiting the remnants of Eric the Red's thousand-year-old Norse
                        colonies is a must do if exploring southern Greenland. At their peak, it's estimated that something around
                        5,000 Norsemen lived throughout Greenland. Why the settlements died out remains a mystery. A visit to the sites 
                        of the ruins is a fascinating journey back in time into the lives of these hardy hunter-gatherers.  <br>
                        There are several Viking ruins found in the region including the Hvalsey Fjord Church (oldest 
                        in Greenland - highly recommended, and Brattahlid near the town of Qassiarsuk (20 minutes' boat ride from Narsarsuaq 
                        international airport).

                        The Northern Lights are often referred to as the 'the biggest light show on earth,' 
                        and during your visit to Greenland, if at all possible, you shouldn't miss this incredible natural spectacle.
                        If planning to visit for the sole purpose of seeing the Aurora Borealis, then make sure to travel in winter. <br>
                        There's a good chance of seeing the Northern Lights anytime between November and March,
                        although December through February are the best months because the nights are clearer.
                        The Northern Lights are visible across Greenland. Qaqortoq (south), Ittoqqortoormiit (east), 
                        and Kangerlussuaq (west) provide the best views.

                        southern uplands of Iceland and back. It is the area that contains most tours and travel-related activities in Iceland.

                        Roughly two kilometers from the town of Ilulissat, you'll find this ancient Eskimo settlement, first excavated at the beginning of
                        the 20th century, which boasts some of the best-preserved remnants of indigenous Eskimo cultures in the Arctic. 
                        The ancient village is abandoned, but you can still see artefacts from the inhabitants who lived here more than 2,000 years ago. 
                        To get to Sermermiut by foot takes roughly an hour. From the center of Ilulissat,
                        walk south to the old Heliport and then follow the boardwalk a further 1.2 kilometers south to the shore of the Icefjord.
                        Finds from the site are displayed in the Ilulissat Museum.

                        Itterajivit, formerly Kap Hope, was a small village in the Sermersooq municipality in eastern Greenland. It was abandoned in late 2005. It was the last remaining populated settlement outside Ittoqqortoormiit, located on Liverpool Land, across the Rosenvinge bay to the west of the town.
