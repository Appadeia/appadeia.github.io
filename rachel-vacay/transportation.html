                        The views are fabulous when travelling from town to town in Greenland and the journey is an experience in
                        itself.
                        There are no roads between the towns in Greenland and as the distances are large, the vast majority of traffic
                        from town to town is with Air Greenland and their Dash 8-200 aircraft. There is room for 37 passengers and the
                        planes fly so low that you have a magnificent view and you can see Greenland from above on the journey.

                        Greenland's ferries are a stylish way to get around Greenland. The Artic Umiaq line goes through around a dozen cities
                        from Ilulissat in the north to Qaqortoq in the south. There are two types of overnight ferries: cabins and couchettes. 
                        Cabins have private bathrooms as well as a table, chair, TV, wardrobe, and other amenities. Couchettes are cheaper, but have
                        shared bathrooms and up to eight berths per section. Most passengers bring sleeping bags.
