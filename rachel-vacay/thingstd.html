                        Tourists can go snowmobiling or skiing in Greenland, but nothing compares to the old tradition of traveling with
                        dogs pulling your sled. It's an unforgettable experience of dogs joining forces to pull your sled. These
                        adorable dogs love hard work and love to run in cold temperatures. They know the snow – sled dogs know where
                        ice is too thin and don’t go there so it's safe.
