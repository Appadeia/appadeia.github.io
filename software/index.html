			<h1>Software Freedom & You</h1>
			<h2>What is software freedom?</h2>
			<p>
				Free software is not free as in free beer. <em>(Although all free software is free as in free beer.)</em> Free software is free as in liberty.
				Software freedom covers four main points:
				<ul>
					<li>Freedom to run the program at any time, for any purpose. No strings attached.</li>
					<li>Freedom to to see how the program works, and to modify it. </li>
					<li>Freedom to share copies.</li>
					<li>Freedom to share edited copies.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h2>Why should I care about software freedom?</h2>
			<p>
				It's 2018. The amount of data gathering corporations do on you for ad profit is at an alltime high. <br>
				There's also been controversies like where <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/01/12/technology/apple-iphone-slow-battery-lawsuit/index.html">Apple got sued for slowing down iPhones</a> without telling consumers. <br>
				Furthermore, with the existence of free software; piracy really isn't needed. I'm sure at least one person reading this website has pirated something. Whether that be a videogame, Photoshop, or something else. <br>
				There's no reason to risk getting prosecuted for piracy when you can look at free software alternatives.
			</p>
			<h2>What free software is there to pick from?</h2>
			There's <strong>so</strong> much variety to choose from. If you're just interested in free software for your nonfree computer, Google is your friend. <br>
			If you'd rather have a list, here's an <a href="https://fossbytes.com/windows-10-free-open-source-software-alternative/">article</a>. <br>
			However, if you're a bit more ambitious, you can make the leap to Linux. It's extremely amazing compared to Windowss or OSX. <br>
			For one, there's so many themes, it's like going to the world's largest mall on an unlimited credit card. <br>
			If you want your cursor to be <a href="https://store.kde.org/p/999536/">extremely rainbow</a>, there's nothing stopping you from making it rainbow. <br>
			<h2>Great Linux OSes for beginners</h2>
			<em>Note: I will be referring to these as "Linux Distros" or simply "Distros."</em>
			Making a leap to Linux is as easy as picking out what you want.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/">Ubuntu MATE.</a> Preconfigured themes that resemble about anything available out of the box.</li>
			  	<li><a href="https://xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu.</a> Not the prettiest out of the box, but it can run on just about anything and you can make it look good with just a theme or two.</li>
				<li><a href="https://neon.kde.org/">KDE Neon.</a>Comes with one of if not the most configurable interface possible. If you can see it, you can change it. If you want your buttons to be blood red and your window titles cyan, nobody's stopping you.</li>
			</ul>
			Once you've decided on a distro, you just need to burn it to a CD, DVD, or a USB. <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Etcher</a> is a good program for burning to USB. It's really simple. Pick your downloaded image file, have your USB plugged in, and go at it. <br>
			If you're using a CD or a DVD, Google is your friend. <br>
			Once you burn the image, you need to open up Disk Management <a href="https://www.dummies.com/computers/pcs/how-to-shrink-a-hard-drive-volume-in-windows/">and follow this tutorial.</a> Once you've shrunken your main volume, restart your computer. <br>
			This varies from computer to computer, but generally, mashing Esc, F1, F2, F11, or F12 will take you to a screen where you can pick where to boot from. If you picked DVD or CD, choose that. If you picked USB, choose that. Make sure you have your storage plugged in. After doing that, the installer should take you through the rest of the process. <br>
			If you have any issues, Google is your friend; you can also go to <a href="discord.gg/discord-linux">this Discord server</a> if you use Discord for support. If you're old-fashioned, you can also send an email to <a href="mailto:carson.black@stu.franklin.kyschools.us">carson.black@stu.franklin.kyschools.us</a> and I'll do my best to help you.
